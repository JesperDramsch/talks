# What are some strategies? <!--fit-->

Building a common belief system!

Inspired by "Tribal Marketing"


---

## üçº **The¬†Creation Story**

> ‚ÄúWhere you come from is as important for people to know as what you believe and what¬†your advantages are.‚Äù 

Every belief system comes with a story. 

*Gilligan‚Äôs Island*¬†and¬†*The Brady Bunch*¬†began with a theme song that outlined the story‚Äôs premise, Schwartz said,¬†‚ÄúBecause the confused do not laugh.‚Äù

---     
## ‚ú® **The¬†Values**

Defining, understanding and¬†communicating your mission to community members is critical to your¬†community success. 

- Coke lets everyone know ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the real thing.‚Äù¬†
- Nike says, ‚ÄúJust do it.‚Äù 
- Campbell‚Äôs makes it clear that ‚ÄúSoup is good food.‚Äù 

---
## üåë **The¬†Icons & Tokens**

Identity and values resonate from icons and their instant concentrations of meaning. 

- Pronoun pins
- Emoji in Twitter name
- The Stanley Cup

People in the public eye can also become¬†icons, such as Virgin‚Äôs Richard Branson. 

---
## üî• **The¬†Rituals**

> ‚ÄúRituals¬†are the repeated interaction that people have with your enterprise‚Äù¬†

and they can be imbued with either positive or negative meaning. 

Communities¬†must consider how they can make these touchpoints with their values and¬†ideology more pleasant, engaging, enhanced, simplified, less frustrating,¬†and more fun.

---
## üòà **The¬†Unbelievers**

For every believer, there is a¬†nonbeliever.

These unbelievers allow believers to define themselves through¬†contrast. By defining the unbelievers, you define who you are by demonstrating¬†the antithesis of your position. 

That‚Äôs why 7Up declared itself the¬†‚Äúuncola‚Äù and Taco Bell wants us to ‚Äúthink outside the bun.‚Äù 

---
## üí¨ **The¬†Common Language**

You must know a group‚Äôs sacred¬†words to belong within that group. 

These sacred words set people apart¬†from others and bind them together as members of a group. This specific¬†language helps them work together effectively. 

---

## üìö **The Mentors**

> ‚ÄúAll¬†successful belief systems have a person who is the catalyst, the risk taker, the visionary, the iconoclast‚Ä¶‚Äù

Talk about thought leaders in your space!

Possibly recruit them to your community!

---
## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **The Superpowers**
    
Common insights, shortcuts and knowledge of the group that accelerates their power and productivity.

Shared resources, meetings, access to things and accelerated results.

---
## üôå **Don't go alone**

You'll start alone.

Someone said to me building a community is training other leadership to take your community further.


--- 

## ü§ù From the discussion:

All of these aspects of community live on a spectrum.

From loose acquaintances to zealous cult, we probably want to hit the middle somewhere.

Choose what you care about and pursue it with integrity.

Include your kind of people.
