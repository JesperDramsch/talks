A guide on how to find and build a community that is welcoming, diverse, and aligned with your beliefs. 

The author, Jesper Dramsch, shares their personal experience of participating in various communities, including queer munches, gaming discords, and professional communities, and highlights the issues that led to their departure, such as lack of diversity and recognition, questionable ethics, and personality cults. 

The talk offers strategies for building a successful community, including creating a common belief system, defining values, using icons and tokens, establishing rituals, having a common language, recruiting mentors, and sharing superpowers. Where I also emphasize the importance of strong moderation, easy access, and being welcoming to everyone.
