### 🔁 THE REPRODUCIBILITY CRISIS
Machine learning can do amazing feats. BUT time and time again, we see problems reproducing the findings.

Why?

- Randomness of neural networks
- Software versions
- Different hardware
- Proprietary data
- Proprietary labels

### 💥 SUSTAINABLE MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS
Let's educate researchers not in ML on how to make their awesome experiments using ML reproducible.

The plan from the video: 🛠️ Create a workshop for ML applications 🎥 Keep going with YouTube ✒️ Write more articles 📣 More Talks

### 🛠️ THE WORKSHOP
What does Workshop for Sustainable Machine Learning applications in Research look like?

Open to ideas, here's a start

- fix random seeds
- provide software versions
- use best practices
- interpretable and explainable AI

Maybe PyData will have me?

## CONCLUSION

For this Software Sustainability Institute 2022 fellowship I plan to:

- Create a workshop for ML applications
- Keep going with YouTube
- Write more articles
- Give More Talks
