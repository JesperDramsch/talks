### 🔁 THE REPRODUCIBILITY CRISIS
Machine learning can do amazing feats. BUT time and time again, we see problems reproducing the findings.

Why?

- Randomness of neural networks
- Software versions
- Different hardware
- Proprietary data
- Proprietary labels

### 💥 SUSTAINABLE MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS
Let's educate researchers not in ML on how to make their awesome experiments using ML reproducible.

The plan from the video: 🛠️ Create a workshop for ML applications 🎥 Keep going with YouTube ✒️ Write more articles 📣 More Talks

### 🛠️ THE WORKSHOP
What does Workshop for Sustainable Machine Learning applications in Research look like?

Open to ideas, here's a start

- fix random seeds
- provide software versions
- use best practices
- interpretable and explainable AI

Maybe PyData will have me?

### 🎥 KEEP YOUTUBE GOING
My Youtube revolves around

- 🤖 machine learning
- 💾 data science
- 🐍 Python programming
- 👔 careers

And I love talking about making these accessible. Access to open software is at the core of making research reproducible and good.


### ✒️WRITING
I wrote 60 articles last year.

These two fall squarely into the content that will help you make machine learning work in your research.

> Get a Software Person!

> If Your Model Doesn't Work, Make it Smaller

### 📣 TALKS

I have presented a bunch of my research, but that's very different to giving a PyData conference talk.

With the help of the amazing mentors for first-timers like myself, I started the "How to Guarantee ..." - series

There's a playlist.

## CONCLUSION

For this Software Sustainability Institute 2022 fellowship I plan to:

- Create a workshop for ML applications
- Keep going with YouTube
- Write more articles
- Give More Talks
